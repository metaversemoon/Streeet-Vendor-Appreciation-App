## How is made

* WorldCoin Verifies users before posting a review or a new vendor post
 makes sure users create only one event for a class per person to avoid any scams.

* Alluo: Helps to set up stream payments from the contract for every food street vendor  We are using the IbAlluo contract directly to create streams for class events and donations.

* Xmtp Connects to a direct chat between Street vendors and supporters and allows donators to chat with organizers and members of the groups.

* Skale Network Deployed app on Skale network(0x16d7be29ebc6db2e9c92E0Bf1dE5c1cfe6b1AD2a) for NFT donations, NFT creations, and stream payments for Street Vendors.

* Mumbai Polygon Network Deployed app on the Polygon Mumbai Network(0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3) for NFT donations, NFT creations, and stream payments for Street Vendors.

* Covalent Helps to display a dashboard of all transactions by contract and fetches all NFTS that were donated to on the food street vendor page.


* IPFS NFTStorage Used IPFS to store all food street vendor data facilitated the storage of NFTS, details of the class, and metadata of every event class. We are also, saving all the reviews, tags, class difficulty, class quality, and ratings.

* We used Solidity for the smart contract.
